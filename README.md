## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

# ForeFlight Interview
The ForeFlight development team would like to get a better picture of your coding and problem solving skills. Please build a program that implements the specification below. Some guidelines to keep in mind:
 
* You may use any open source / public libraries that you like.
* Your future peers will be reviewing your submission so write it appropriately.
 
## Specification
### Input:
  - One or more airport identifiers: `kaus`, `50r`, `egll`, `khou` . 
 
### Output:
 
 A web page with the following:
 - The airport identifier (icao)
 - The airport name
 - The available runways
 - The lat/long of the airport
 - A current weather report that contains the following
    - Temp (F)
    - Relative humidity (%)
    - Summary of cloud coverage (text string)
        - This is the greatest amount of coverage listed if any
    - Visibility (Statute Miles)
    - Wind Speed (MPH)
    - Wind Direction (cardinal directions to secondary-intercardinal precision)
 
#### Data Sources
The data sources for this exercise can be accessed while the development server is running. 
- `Airport` data can be obtained at: http://localhost:3000/airports/<airport_identifier>.json . 
    - Ex. http://localhost:3000/airports/kaus.json
- `Weather Conditions` can be obtained at:  http://localhost:3000/weather/<airport_identifier>.json
    - Ex. http://localhost:3000/weather/kaus.json
